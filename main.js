// Create a variable names songs 
// Store your 5 favourite songs in array - put your favourite song first in the array 
// - One way to test whether something is an array is to use the built-in `Array.isArray` method (function).

//TICKET 3 - NOTATION: HOW TO READ ITEMS IN AN ARRAY âœ…
// - Log your second favorite song (index 1)
// - Log your most favorite song (index 0)

// TICKET 4 - NOTATION: HOW TO MODIFY ITEMS IN AN ARRAY âœ…
// Replace your fifth song with 'Baby Shark'
// Use bracket notation to access the item and use the assignment operator to reassign it to 'Baby Shark'.
// Then log the array to the console to check that the fifth song is now 'Baby Shark' ðŸŽ‰

// - Inside the loop, multiply the current value by 10 and reassign to the array at that index
